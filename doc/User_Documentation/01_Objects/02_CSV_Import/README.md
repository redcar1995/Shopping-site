## Column Configuration

The column configuration how CSV columns are mapped to object properties.

## Resolver Settings

Objects can be looked up in different ways. Your CSV export might have a `filename` column so you decide to match via the filename.
There are different resolver strategies available. The simplest one is the `ID` strategy which expects that a column value matches exactly with a object ID.
In some cases you might want to implement your own strategy. The [Code Resolver](./01_Resolver/05_Code.md) allows you to do this.
