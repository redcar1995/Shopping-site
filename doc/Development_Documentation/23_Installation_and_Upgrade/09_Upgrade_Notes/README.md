# Upgrade Notes

## 6.2.0 
- Support for links and folders as a fallback document, details see [#4860](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/4860)
- Documents & DataObjects: save button (visible when user has no publish permission) does not unpublish element anymore (if user has unpublish permission). 
  Details see [#4905](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/issues/4905)


### Workflow Refactorings
- Notifications for workflows now support Pimcore notifications. Due to that, some namespaces
  were renamed. If you don't have overwritten any of the internal classes, no action is needed. 
   - `Pimcore\Workflow\EventSubscriber\NotificationEmailSubscriber` became `Pimcore\Workflow\EventSubscriber\NotificationSubscriber`  
   - `Pimcore\Workflow\NotificationEmail\NotificationEmailInterface` became `Pimcore\Workflow\NotificationEmail\NotificationInterface` 


## 6.1.2
- Sessions: the native PHP session mechanism is now the default (instead of `session.handler.native_file`). 
To use the former handler use the following config: 
```yaml
framework:
    session:
        handler_id:  session.handler.native_file
        save_path:   "%kernel.root_dir%/../var/sessions"
```
If you have configured your own session handler nothing will change. 

## 6.1.0 

### E-Commerce Framework Refactorings
- New methods in interfaces - only relevant, when you directly implement interfaces. If you just extend existing E-Commerce Framework
  implementations, default implementations for the new methods are provided.
  - New method in `EcommerceFrameworkBundle\EnvironmentInterface`: `public function setDefaultCurrency(Currency $currency);` - default implementation in `Environment` available.
  - New method in `CartInterface`: `public function getPricingManagerTokenInformationDetails(): array` - default implementation in `AbstractCart` available.
  - New method in `CartInterface`: `public function isCalculated(): bool` - default implementation in `AbstractCart` available.
  - New method in `CartPriceCalculatorInterface`: `public function getAppliedPricingRules(): array;` - default implementation in `CartPriceCalculator` available.
  - New method in `BracketInterface`: `public function getConditionsByType(string $typeClass): array;` - default implementation in `Bracket` available.
  - New method in `RuleInterface`: `public function getConditionsByType(string $typeClass): array` - default implementation in `Rule` available.
  - New method in `VoucherServiceInterface`: `public function getPricingManagerTokenInformationDetails(CartInterface $cart, string $locale = null): array;` - default implementation in `DefaultService` available.
  - New method in `CartFactoryInterface`: `public function getCartReadOnlyMode(): string;` - default implementation in `CartFactory` available.
  
- Changed return type of `applyCartRules(CartInterface $cart)` in `PricingManagerInterface` - from `PricingManagerInterface` to `array`  
- Introduction of new Checkout Manager architecture. It is parallel to the old architecture, which is deprecated now and will be removed in 
  Pimcore 7. For details see [Checkout Manager Details](../../10_E-Commerce_Framework/13_Checkout_Manager/08_Checkout_Manager_Details.md).
