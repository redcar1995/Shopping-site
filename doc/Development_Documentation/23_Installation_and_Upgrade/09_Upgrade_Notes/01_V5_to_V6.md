## Upgrading Pimcore from Version 5.8.x to Version 6.0

- PHP >=7.2 is required
- IE11 is not officially supported anymore. That doesn't mean that IE11 won't work anymore straight away (although a warning will be shown on login), but that's not guaranteed anymore for the entire lifecycle of v6.
- Symfony 4 is now the default version used by Pimcore, if you'd like to stay on the current LTS version of Symfony (3.4), please add the following to your project-specific `composer.json`: `"symfony/symfony": "^3.4.17"`
- `sensio/generator-bundle` has been removed in favour of Symfony 4. You can still use `pimcore:generate:bundle` command to generate Pimcore Bundle Skeleton.
- `twig/twig` dependency was changed from `^2.0` to `^2.4`
- `sensio/distribution-bundle` has been removed. Replace the following lines in your 
existing `composer.json` file **_BEFORE_** you perform the update!

Config to replace:
```
    "post-install-cmd": [
      "Pimcore\\Composer::postInstall",
      "@symfony-scripts"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "Pimcore\\Composer::postUpdate",
      "@symfony-scripts",
      "Pimcore\\Composer::executeMigrationsUp"
    ],
    "pre-package-update": [
      "Pimcore\\Composer::prePackageUpdate"
    ],
    "symfony-scripts": [
      "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::clearCache",
      "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets",
      "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installRequirementsFile",
      "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::prepareDeploymentTarget"
    ]     
```

Replacement: 
```
    "post-install-cmd": [
      "Pimcore\\Composer::postInstall",
      "@pimcore-scripts"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "Pimcore\\Composer::postUpdate",
      "@pimcore-scripts",
      "Pimcore\\Composer::executeMigrationsUp"
    ],
    "pimcore-scripts": [
      "Pimcore\\Composer::clearCache",
      "Pimcore\\Composer::installAssets"
    ]
```
