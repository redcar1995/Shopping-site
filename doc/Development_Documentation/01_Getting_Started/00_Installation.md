# Pimcore Installation

The following guide assumes your're using a typical LAMP environment, if you're using a different setup (eg. Nginx) or facing a problem, please visit the [Installation Guide](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/README.md) section.

## 1. System Requirements

Please have a look at [System Requirements](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/01_System_Requirements.md) and ensure your system is ready for Pimcore.

## 2. Install Pimcore Sources

The easiest way to install Pimcore is from your terminal using our installer package.
We additionally provide a [Composer based install guide](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/03_System_Setup_and_Hosting/04_Composer_Install.md) and of course you can install Pimcore also without the help of the command line using your favorite tools (SFTP, ...).

Change into the root folder of your project (**please remember project root != document root**):

```bash
cd /your/project
```

Pimcore is offering [2 installation packages](https://pimcore.com/en/download) for different use-cases:

| Version | Description |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Latest Release** | The latest release version of Pimcore. Good choice for all purposes ;-)         |
| **Nightly Build**  | Daily released version. Shouldn't be used in production but ok for development. |

### Download a Package:

```bash
wget https://pimcore.com/download-5/pimcore-latest.zip -O pimcore-install.zip
```

Unzip the installer package into the current folder (project root):

```bash
unzip pimcore-install.zip
```

Point the document root of your vhost to the newly created `/web` folder out of the ZIP archive (eg. `/your/project/web`).
Keep in mind, that Pimcore needs to be installed **outside** of the **document root**.
Specific configurations and optimizations for your webserver are available here:
[Apache](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/03_System_Setup_and_Hosting/01_Apache_Configuration.md),
[Nginx](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/03_System_Setup_and_Hosting/02_Nginx_Configuration.md)

Pimcore requires write access to the following directories (relative to your project root): `/var`, `/web/var` and `/pimcore`
([Details](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/03_System_Setup_and_Hosting/03_File_Permissions.md))

> No CLI? Click [Latest Release](https://pimcore.com/download/pimcore-latest.zip) or [Nightly Build](https://www.pimcore.org/download/pimcore-data.zip) to download the package with your browser and extract/upload Pimcore manually on your server (outside document root!).

## 3. Create Database

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE project_database charset=utf8mb4;"
```

For further information please visit out [DB Setup Guide](../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/03_System_Setup_and_Hosting/05_DB_Setup.md)

## 4. Launch Pimcore and Finish Installation

### Web installer

Finish the Pimcore installation by accessing the URL (eg. `https://your-host.com/install`) in your web browser.

1. Fill in the required fields (database + admin user)
2. Press ***Check Requirements*** to check if your system is ready for Pimcore
3. Click ***Install Now!***
4. Remove the file `web/install.php` as it isn't needed anymore

### CLI installer

Alternatively, you can use the CLI installer to install pimcore. The installer will guide you through the installation
interactively.

```
$ bin/install pimcore:install
```

Every parameter can be set as option to make the install automated. The `--no-interaction` flag will avoid any interactive
prompts:

```
$ bin/install pimcore:install --profile demo-basic \
  --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --mysql-username username --mysql-password password --mysql-database pimcore5 \
  --no-interaction
```

To avoid having to pass sensitive data (e.g. DB password) as command line option, you can also set each parameter as env
variable. See `bin/install pimcore:install --help` for details. Example:

```
$ PIMCORE_INSTALL_MYSQL_USERNAME=username PIMCORE_INSTALL_MYSQL_PASSWORD=password bin/install pimcore:install \
  --profile demo-basic \
  --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --mysql-database pimcore5 \
  --no-interaction
```

Please also remove the `web/install.php` file after the installation is complete.

### Debugging installation issues

The installer writes a log in `var/installer/logs` which contains any errors encountered during the installation. Please
have a look at the logs as a starting point when debugging installation issues.


## 5. Maintenance Cron Job

```text
*/5 * * * * /your/project/bin/console maintenance
```

Keep in mind, that the cron job has to run as the same user as the web interface to avoid permission issues (eg. `www-data`).

### 5.1 Add some randomness (optional)

In case you've got multiple Pimcore Projects on one (Development-)Server, you can add some randomness to the start times of the cron Jobs to mitigate the risk of multiple tasks starting in parallel.

```bash
# We need bash since RANDOM is a bash builtin
SHELL=/bin/bash

*/5 * * * * sleep $[ ( $RANDOM % 120 ) + 1 ]s ; /your/project/bin/console maintenance
```

## 6. Additional Information & Help
