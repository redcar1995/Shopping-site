# Core Testing

Pimcore uses [Codeception](https://codeception.com/) for testing its core features. 

To execute core tests, Pimcore provides a `docker-compose` file to create a setup for running the tests. 

> The docker images are based on the debug images, thus it is also possible to debug the tests using xdebug. 
> Make sure, that path mappings are applied correctly though

## Requirements
- `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.
- Pimcore git repository cloned locally 


## Preparations
- Change to `tests\bin` directory of the Pimcore repository
- Execute `./init-tests.sh`, this does:  
  - Running `docker-compose up -d` and setting up all necessary services (like db and redis). Pimcore source code files 
    are mounted into docker container, so you can change files and test the changes right away.
  - Copying some files from `.github\ci\file` to prepare system for executing the tests (actually same as for github actions)
  - Executing `composer install` to install all dependencies
  - Print out further instructions

Now the system is ready and tests can be executed inside the docker containers (see also commands below). 

After finishing, shutdown docker containers and cleanup volumes with `docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans`.


## Executing tests

#### Run all tests

This will run all tests.
```
docker-compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/codecept run -c . -vvv
```

#### Only run a specific suite

Only runs the `Model` tests. For a list of suites see the list below.

```
docker-compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/codecept run -c . Model -vvv
```

#### Only run a specific test group

This can be a subset of a suite. You also have the option to provide a comma-seperated list of groups.
For an overview of available groups see the table below.

```
docker-compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/codecept run -c . Model -vvv -g dataTypeLocal
```


##### Redis Cache tests

For Redis, the `PIMCORE_TEST_REDIS_DSN` option is mandatory. If not using the Redis provided by the docker-compose, set it 
to a value that does not conflict to any other Redis DBs on your system.

```
docker-compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/codecept run -c . Cache
```


##### Check Logfiles
Don't forget to check logfiles (especially `test.log` and `php.log`) inside the docker container when problems occur.


#### Important Environment Variables

Meaningful default values are set in the shipped `docker-compose.yml`. Can be modified as needed. 

| Env Variable           | Example          | Comment                                                     |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| APP_ENV                | test             | Test environment                         |
| PIMCORE_TEST           | 1                | **important** this will switch several directories (like /var/classes) |
| PIMCORE_TEST_SKIP_DB   | 1                | Skips DB setup. This does not skip the db-related tests but it<br>reduces the setup time for tests that don't need a database. |
| PIMCORE_TEST_REDIS_DSN | redis://localhost| **required for REDIS tests**   |

#### Suites

The tests are organized into suites, each one covering specific areas of the core.

| Suite name | Description                                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cache      | Cache tests                                                    |
| Ecommerce  | Ecommerce bundle tests                                         |
| Model      | Dataobject tests                                               |
| Service    | Test covering common or shared element tasks (versioning, ...) |
| Unit       | Other tests (may need restructuring)                           |
| ...        |                                                                |

#### Groups

The following table lists all groups currently used by Pimcore's core tests. If you extend the tests or write new
ones please tag them accordingly.

| Group                              |                                                                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

See [Codeception Commands](https://codeception.com/docs/reference/Commands) for more options.

## Providing new tests & extending existing ones

In general, contributions in form extending and improving tests is highly appreciated.
Please follow the structure and principles described above.

If you have the extend the data model then please have a look at [Model.php](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/blob/10.x/tests/_support/Helper/Model.php).
There you will find all class definitions used for testing.

### Perform PHPStan Analysis

First, get a copy of this [sample configuration file](../../../Samples/phpstan.neon) and place it in your root directory.

Add dependencies:
```sh
# minimum
composer require "phpstan/phpstan:^0.12" "phpstan/phpstan-symfony:^0.12"

# required if you want to do a full analysis
composer require "elasticsearch/elasticsearch:^7.11" "composer/composer:*" "spiritix/php-chrome-html2pdf:^1.6"
cp -rv vendor/pimcore/pimcore/.github/ci/files/var .
```

Run
```sh
TMPDIR=/tmp/[dedicateddir] ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=-1
```

where `/tmp/[dedicateddir]` must be a writable temporary directory.

## PHPStan Baseline Feature

PHPStan can create a baseline file, which contain all current errors. See this [blog](https://medium.com/@ondrejmirtes/phpstans-baseline-feature-lets-you-hold-new-code-to-a-higher-standard-e77d815a5dff) entry.

To generate a new baseline file you have to execute following command:
```sh
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=-1 --generate-baseline
```

With this baseline file include, we can detect new errors without having to fix all errors first.
